##### This mod pack is a work in progress and there's a lot of work to do.

---
### TODO:
* fix Toms create storage (mod sort sprite missing)
* ~~disable several Crafts & Additions features, as New Age
shall be used in lieu of it.~~ Create new age requires review.
it is poorly balanced and having it along with Crafts & additions
allows for an infinite energy exploit. (I probably should use C&A for nw)

* for my own convenience, make a md mod-list maker script
* re-add original brass recipe
* alter computercraft recipes to fit create
* alter Tom's simple storage recipes to fit create

* fork [aerolith](https://github.com/ly-nxs/aerolith) and bake the clear-void mod into it
* add [fabric-seasons](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-seasons) and configs for modded crops
  * perhaps add immersive snow along with it?
